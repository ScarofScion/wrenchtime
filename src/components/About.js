      When I grew up I was lucky to have a mechanic as a stepfather. While we
      not have gotten along in every way he did show me how to work on my car.
      My stepdad while is no banker is a pretty decent mechanic. Which means he
      always owned very old beater cars. He would buy a car, fix it up and then
      sell it for a bit of profit. We definitely had our share of cars. Mostly
      Hondas. Staring with the Accord, two Civics, CRX, and CR-V. We also had a
      few Nissans. Maxima, 240sx, and my 350z. Not mentioning the domestic
      car/van like the a police Crown Vic, GM Astro Van and many more. However
      even after this amount of experience and I also had a huge interest in
      cars I did not actively maintain my car properly. While stepdad can swap
      an engine and replace a transmission he's never really owned a car he
      wanted to keep forever.
